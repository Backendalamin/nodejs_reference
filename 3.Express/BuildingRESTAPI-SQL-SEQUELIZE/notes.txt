The error you're encountering suggests that the Sequelize connection to your SQL Server is failing. 
Given that your SQL Server is set up to use Windows Authentication (Integrated Security) 
and the sequelize library doesn't directly support Windows Authentication via connection
 strings, you need to use an additional library called tedious for this.

Here's a detailed step-by-step approach to address the issue:

Step 1: Install tedious
Ensure you have tedious installed, as it's required for Sequelize to communicate with MSSQL: npm install tedious
