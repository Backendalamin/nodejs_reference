// Routes are a better way of organizing an application 
// because they enable logical grouping and separation of 
// concerns, which leads to better maintainability, scalability, 
// and readability. Here's why grouping user domains from product
//  domains using routes is beneficial:

// Modular Organization: Routes allow you to organize your application
//  into modules or domains, such as users, products, orders, etc.
//  Each module can have its own set of routes, handlers, and logic,
//   making it easier to manage and understand.

// Separation of Concerns: Grouping routes based on domains
//  promotes separation of concerns. User-related routes,
//   handlers, and logic are kept separate from p
//   roduct-related ones, reducing complexity and making 
//   it easier to maintain and modify specific parts of the 
//   pplication without affecting others.

// Code Reusability: By organizing routes into 
// separate modules, you can reuse common 
// functionality across different parts of your application.
//  For example, authentication middleware or error handling
//   logic can be applied globally or to specific modules as needed.

// Scalability: As your application grows, having organized routes 
// makes it easier to scale by adding new features or expanding 
// existing ones. New modules can be added without disrupting 
// existing functionality, and related routes can be grouped 
// together for clarity and coherence.

// Readability and Maintainability: Well-organized routes 
// improve code readability and maintainability. Developers
//  can easily locate and understand relevant parts of the
//   codebase, leading to faster development cycles and
//    reduced chances of introducing bugs.

// Testing: Grouping routes based on domains facilitates 
// more targeted and focused testing. You can write tests specifically
//  for user-related functionality or product-related functionality,
//   ensuring comprehensive test coverage and easier debugging.
