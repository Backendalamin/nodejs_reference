Docker is a platform for running applications in lightweight units called containers

why Docker? 
1: easier to run apps in any environment quickly, e.g running dev and prod of APIs with a single line of code
instead of weeks of installing tools for that project

2: Lowered costs of running apps on cloud services ... in normal scenraion one runs different pieces of your app in the cloud 
leading to higer costs billed per resources. With Docker You migrate each part of
your application to a container, and then you can run the whole application in containers using Azure Kubernetes Service or Amazon’s Elastic Container Service, or on
your own Docker cluster in the datacenter.

3: moving application into a distributed system, whre each feature is dockerized and runned on its own virtual network.
These mini apps can then communicate to each other without exposing the app to the world hence avoiding the monolith way of building 
a big feature in a whole month and redeploying it.

4: Serverless apps and more 
A single cluster of servers running Docker can run every type of application, and 
you build, deploy, and manage them all in the same way no matter what architecture or 
technology stack they use

cleaning packages or containers 
docker container rm -f $(docker container ls -aq)


check docker version
docker version

CREATING A DCOKER IMAGE 
https://docs.docker.com/get-started/02_our_app/
must be in powershell , put this command ---- New-Item -Path . -Name Dockerfile -ItemType File

build the image 
docker build -t getting-started .


if you start getting errorsd like cannot fetch ananymous token or error response from deomon docker
just add an access token to docker desktop
https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/
access token via login docker login --username <YOUR_USERNAME>
docker login -u 254alamin
for passsword put your token

or if the token cant be signedin, just login in with your username
 and your normal password you signed to docker hub like in my case where I struggled signing in for 
 almost 3 hours

without signing in , the connection to pull public container or build container will be disrupted

once an image is created , you dont need node modules to run the app 
# Install node packages, install serve, build the app, and remove dependencies at the end
RUN npm install \
    && npm install -g serve \
    && npm run build \
    && rm -fr node_modules

docker build -t welcome-to-docker .
Breaking down this command

to see your images , close and open docker to refresh it and it will appear

The -t flag tags your image with a name. (welcome-to-docker in this case). And the .
 lets Docker know where it can find the Dockerfile.





running a container
docker container run diamol/ch02-hello-diamol


docker container run --interactive --tty diamol/base
The --interactive flag tells Docker you want to set up a connection to the container,
and the --tty flag means you want to connect to a terminal session inside the container. The output will show Docker pulling the image, and then you’ll be left with a
command prompt

get details of all the running containers
docker container ls

docker container top lists the processes running in the container 

docker container logs .....displays any log entries the container
has collected

docker container inspect shows you all the details of a
container
 docker container inspect container-name
