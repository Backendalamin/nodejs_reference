1. console.log(process.env):

This line prints the contents of the process.env object in your Node.js application.
The process.env object is a built-in object in Node.js that stores environment variables. These variables are set outside of your code, typically during system configuration or when starting your application.
Environment variables are key-value pairs that provide a way to configure your application without modifying the code itself.
Common Use Cases of Environment Variables:

Database Credentials: You can store database connection details (username, password, etc.) as environment variables to avoid hardcoding them in your code, improving security.
API Keys: API keys for external services can be stored as environment variables to keep them confidential.
Configuration Settings: You can define application-specific configurations (like port numbers, logging levels) as environment variables.
2. console.log(process.argv):

This line prints the values of the process.argv array in your Node.js application.
The process.argv array contains the command-line arguments passed when you start your Node.js script.
The first element (process.argv[0]) is always the path to the Node.js executable, while the second element (process.argv[1]) is the path to your Node.js script itself.
Any additional arguments you provide on the command line are stored in subsequent elements of the array (starting from index 2).
Common Use Cases of Command-Line Arguments:

Passing Input Data: You can pass data to your Node.js script through command-line arguments, allowing for customization of behavior without modifying the script itself.
Specifying Configuration Options: You can use command-line arguments to configure specific settings for your script on the fly.
